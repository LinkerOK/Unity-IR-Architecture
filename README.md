# Unity-IR-Architecture
Using interactors and repositories in unity.

Accelerate development for small/middle size games!
Store data in repositories instead of static/singleton (if you use it), and access in interactors.
You can also get access to your data in Editor, using ScriptableObjectInteractor!

IR can save/load your data automatically (in Editor too) instead your own hardcode save-system (:

# Have fun :)
